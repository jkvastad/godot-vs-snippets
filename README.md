# Visual Studio Snippets for Godot

Files ending with .snippet can be used by visual studio to auto-generate code in response to writing shortcuts in the editor.

* [Schema Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets-schema-reference?view=vs-2022)

To add .snippet files to visual studio go to Tools -> Snippet manager (or ctrl+k, ctrl+b) and import the snippet file. The file can then be used in the editor by typing the shortcut specified in the .snippet and it will be picked up by the intellisense.
